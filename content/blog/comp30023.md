## Introduction to Operating Systems

## Processes and Threads

## Inter-process Communication

## Process Scheduling

### Scheduling Algorithm

- Determines which process to run next
- General Scheduling Goals
  - **Fairness**: giving each process a fair share of the CPU
  - **Policy Enforcement**: seeing that stated policy is carried out
  - **Balance**: keeping all parts of the system busy
- When to schedule
  - process created
  - process exits
  - process blocks
  - I/O interrupt
  - clock interrupt

### Process Behaviour

- CPU-bound process vs I/O bound process

### Scheduling Environments

- **Throughput**: _number of jobs per hour_ that the system completes
- **Turnaround time**: average time from moment batch job is submitted to the moment it is completed
- **Response time**: time between issuing a command and getting the result

### Preemptive VS Non-Preemptive Scheduling

- _Preemptive Scheduling_
  - picks a process and lets it run for a **maximum of some fixed time**
    - _quantum_: the amount of time a process is allowed to run the CPU before it is preempted and another process is given a chance to execute
  - **clock interrupts** are needed at the end of the quantum to give control of the CPU back to the scheduler
- _Non-Preemptive Scheduling_
  - picks a process to run and let it run **for as long as it wants** until it **blocks or voluntarily releases** the CPU

{% toast type="col-detail" summary="How to check if a CPU is using Preemptive or Non-Preemptive Scheduling" %}

Run an infinite loop (without I/O operations) and check if the loop is continuously running – if continuously runs ⇒  non-preemptive – if stops itself after a while ⇒ preemptive

### Process / Context Switching

- Happens every time OS switches between processes
- Computationally expensive
- things that happen while context switching
  - saving and loading registers
  - saving and loading memory maps
  - updating tables and lists
  - flushing and reloading memory cache
  - ...

### [Non-Preemptive] First-Come First-Served (FCFS)

![](/assets/comp30023/fcfs.excalidraw.png)

- Processes are assigned to CPU **in the order they arrive**
  - **single queue** of ready processes
  - first job runs and is allowed to run **as long as it wants to** (will not get interrupted for running too long because non-preemptive)
  - new jobs are added to the back of the queue
- Advantages
  - easy to understand and implement/program (single linked list)
  - minimises context switching
- Disadvantages
  - poor performance - high average wait time (convoy effect)
- Used for Batch Systems

{% toast type="col-detail" summary="Convoy Effect" %}

In FCFS, if a long process arrives at the head of the ready queue, all the shorter processes behind it have to wait until the long process finishes. This waiting time is called the convoy effect. The convoy effect can cause a lot of idle time for other processes in the queue, even if they are short and can be executed quickly.

The convoy effect can be particularly problematic in real-time systems or systems that require a high degree of responsiveness. In such systems, long processes can cause significant delays and impact the system's overall performance.

### [Non-Preemptive] Shortest Job First (SJF)

- Picks process with shortest runtime first
- Assumes run times are known in advance
- Example
  - Given:
    - | Process | Arrival Time | Burst/Run Time |
      | :-----: | :----------: | :------------: |
      |    A    |      0       |       12       |
      |    B    |      1       |       4        |
      |    C    |      2       |       4        |
      |    D    |      2       |       4        |
  - ![](/assets/comp30023/sjf.excalidraw.png)
  - | Process | Arrival Time | Start Time | Waiting Time | Finish Time | Turnaround Time |
    | :-----: | :----------: | :--------: | :----------: | :---------: | :-------------: |
    |    B    |      1       |     0      |      0       |      4      |        3        |
    |    C    |      2       |     4      |      2       |      8      |        6        |
    |    D    |      3       |     8      |      5       |     12      |        9        |
    |    A    |      0       |     12     |      12      |     20      |       20        |
  - Average Waiting Time: `(0+2+5+12)/4 = 4.75`
  - Average Turnaround Time: `(3+6+9+20)/4 = 9.5`
- Used for Batch Systems
