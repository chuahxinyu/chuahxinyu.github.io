## Dynamic/Moving Coil Microphones

Dynamic microphones use a simple electromagnetic induction principle to capture sound. Inside the microphone, there is a diaphragm attached to a coil of wire placed within the magnetic field of a magnet. When sound waves hit the diaphragm, it moves the coil within the magnetic field, generating an electrical signal through electromagnetic induction.

### PROs:

- Durable and can handle high sound pressure levels (SPL), making them suitable for live performances.
- Less sensitive to ambient noise, making them useful for rejecting unwanted background sounds.
- Generally more affordable than condenser microphones.

### CONs:

- Typically have a narrower frequency response and lower sensitivity compared to condenser microphones.
- Less accurate and detailed sound reproduction compared to high-end condenser microphones.

## Condenser/Capacitor Microphones

Condenser microphones operate based on the principle of capacitance. Inside the microphone, there are two plates—an extremely thin diaphragm and a backplate—placed close together. The voltage between these plates changes as the distance between them changes due to sound waves. This change in voltage is then transformed into an audio signal.

> Capacitor: A capacitor is an electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field between two conducting plates.

### PROs:

- High sensitivity and a wide frequency response, resulting in detailed and accurate sound reproduction.
- Excellent transient response, making them suitable for capturing fast and subtle changes in sound.
- Commonly used in studio settings for recording vocals and acoustic instruments.

### CONs:

- More fragile compared to dynamic microphones and can be sensitive to environmental conditions.
- Require power (phantom power) to operate, which can limit their use in certain situations.

## Polar Patterns and Headroom

### Omnidirectional Response:

- Captures sound from all directions equally.
- Ideal for capturing a complete perspective of the environment and ambient sounds.
- Useful for creating a natural and immersive recording.
- Examples: Recording a room ambiance or capturing a group conversation.

### Cardioid Response:

- Sensitive to sounds from the front and sides.
- Sounds from the rear are attenuated or canceled out.
- Provides directionality and isolates the main sound source.
- Most common and versatile polar pattern for various recording scenarios.
- Examples: Vocal recording, single instrument recording, podcasting.
