## What is AI?

### Defining AI

- Thinking like a human
  - Requires knowing how human mind process thought, has self-awareness
  - Humans feel emotions and don’t always think rationally
- Thinking rationally
  - More scoped down compared to thinking like human
  - The laws of thought
    - Use inferences to draw conclusions — “Socrates is a man. All men are mortal. Therefore Socrates is mortal”
- A rational agent will perform actions which will (most likely) achieve one’s goals

### Test for Intelligence

#### The Turing Test

- Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950s
- Measure of machine’s ability to **exhibit intelligent behaviour** that is indistinguishable from that of a human
  - imitating human intelligence – The Imitation Game
- Human evaluator engages in **natural language conversations** with a machine and a human
  - if evaluator is unable to consistently distinguish machine from human, machine has passed the Turing Test
- The Loebner Prize (Turing Test) competition was held each year until 2019
  - AI systems are good enough that the test isn’t really meaningful anymore
- The “Total Turing test” allows **physical objects** to be passed (through vision, touch, etc.) to the machines as well as characters

#### Problems with the Turing Test

- it is **not reproducible** — depends a lot on the frame of mind of the analyser
- not amenable to **mathematical analysis**
- **does not imply true intelligence** – machine could be following set of **programmed responses** rather than truly understanding the conversation
- test relies on NLP (Natural Language Processing), which does not accurately reflect the **full range of human intelligence** – emotional intelligence, physical abilities, object recognition etc.

## Intelligent Agents

### Agent Model

- Agent
  - anything that can be viewed as **perceiving** its **environment** through **sensors** and **acting** upon the environment through **actuators**
- 4 parts
    1. Percepts
       -   observations of the environment
       -   made by sensors
       -   agent’s perceptual inputs at any given instant
       -   Percept Sequence
           -   complete history of everything agent has ever perceived
    2. Actions
       - may affect the environment
       - made by actuators
    3. Environment
        - where agent exists
    4. Performance Measure
       - desirability of environment states
       - NOT agent states
         - if we define success in terms of agent’s opinion of own performance, agent would delude itself into believing that it’s perfect
