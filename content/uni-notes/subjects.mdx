I did a Bachelor of Science at the University of Melbourne, majoring in Computing and Software Systems. This repository contains the notes I took during my time there. I hope they can be of use to someone.

I had a lot of thoughts and worries going into university and not being entirely sure what to major in or if the University of Melbourne was the right choice for me. Here are some questions that I had and the answers I found out along the way. Hopefully they can be of help to some anxious first years out there.

## Should I do Computing in the Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Design?

Unimelb made a decent number of changes to BDes Computing while I was in Uni

TBH, if I could go back in time, I _might_ switch to doing BDes (double major in Computing and Graphic Design) instead, because:

1. I am particularly interested in frontend web development and enjoy designing stuff too
2.

If you were not interested in design at all and think that, for instance, if you were not going to do computing, you would fall back to a science-based field (eg. "If I weren't doing computer science, I would be a doctor"), then I would recommend doing BSci.

But to be fair,

1. Many changes to the BDes computing course happened while I was in uni. For instance, they annoyingly changed INFO30005 (it used to be called Web Information Technologies, now called Advanced Interface Prototyping) at the start of my 3rd year which meant that I had to frantically find for another elective to take TT
   and there were a few subjects that we weren't allowed to take as Science Students that were available to the Design student. For instance: INFO10003 (Fundamentals of Interaction Design), INFO20005 (User Interface Development) weren't available as breadths for BSci students when I was in Uni but I believe they are available now. And INFO30008 (Interactive Technology Project) is only available to BDes students though cause it's on of their cores.
   One of my other dissapointments was that I wasn't able to take

But I also didn't really discover my liking of frontend till my second year and I'm not sure about the limitations of BDes students and if they were able to take all of our BSci subjects. Also, because I did so much research and realised that I have basically done all of the computing-related subjects available

However, the university seems to be constantly changing and updating their subjects so I'm not sure if the information I have is still relevant.

The good:

- _Flexibility in Choosing Subjects_: allows you to

The meh:

- _Decision Fatigue_:
