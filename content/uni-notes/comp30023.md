## Introduction to Operating Systems

## Processes and Threads

## Inter-process Communication

## Process Scheduling

### Scheduling Algorithm

- Determines which process to run next
- General Scheduling Goals
  - **Fairness**: giving each process a fair share of the CPU
  - **Policy Enforcement**: seeing that stated policy is carried out
  - **Balance**: keeping all parts of the system busy
- When to schedule
  - process created
  - process exits
  - process blocks
  - I/O interrupt
  - clock interrupt

### Process Behaviour

- CPU-bound process vs I/O bound process
