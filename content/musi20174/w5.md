## Lecture Notes

- **Backbeat:** The backbeat, dominant in pop and rock music from the 1950s to the 70s, plays a crucial role in shaping musical rhythms.

- **Downbeat** In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a shift from the backbeat to the downbeat occurred, favoring a more dynamic, dance-oriented rhythm.

- **Four-on-the-floor** Four-on-the-floor drumming, prominent in disco from the 1970s, has become fundamental in electronic dance music.
