## Week 2: Production Tools and Techniques

- [**Lecture and Tutorial Notes**](/musi20174/w2): This week's content was about Sound Fundamentals, Recording Tech, and MP3's Impact on the Music Industry.
- **DAW Choice**: I chose to use [Waveform 12](https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform-free) because it is free and has a simple interface that is easy to navigate for a beginner.
- **Concept Outline of Assessment Piece**: I like listening to lo-fi music while I study, and would therefore like to produce a short piece of nostalgic lofi music that is inspired by the [Adventure Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Time) series.
- **What I'd like to Achieve in my Track**: My goal is to learn music production techniques to create lofi music, enhancing the ambiance of study and work sessions with a touch of nostalgia from the Adventure Time series.

## Week 3: Music and Technology

- [**Lecture and Tutorial Notes**](/musi20174/w3/): This week's content was about Exploring the Influence of Technology on Musical Style and Interface.
- **Assessment Piece Progress** I've compiled a few of songs and artists ([MUSI20174 Inspiration Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcZLVFyemx_bQ8pQ3VP2tdEXcXcEvy_Tg)) to use as inspiration for my lofi piece. I've also decided to sample the Adventure Time theme song ([Come Along with Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwAL24rbDi4)) and use it as the basis for my piece.

- **Vocal Recording Plan** I don't have many options for spaces to do my recording in but I plan to make up for it by trying different microphones and varying distances from the microphone to the source. I plan to also try to record in the morning when there is less ambient noise.

## Week 4: A Recording Primer
- [Lecture and Tutorial Notes](/musi20174/w4/): This week's content was about the Key differences between microphones, and how their unique characteristics affect your recordings.
- **Practical Studio Assignment, Submission 1**: 

## Week 5: Drums and Percussion
- [Lecture and Tutorial Notes](/musi20174/w5/): This week's content was about the Exploring the Evolution of Rhythmic Styles: Backbeat, Downbeat, and Four-on-the-Floor.
- **Drums and Percussion Analysis** From my [inspiration playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcZLVFyemx_bQ8pQ3VP2tdEXcXcEvy_Tg), I chose two tracks ([The Peace Within - Simon Gro√ü (Air)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97h99XZrKtQ&pp=ygUVVGhlIFBlYWNlIFdpdGhpbiBsb2Zp) | [Steven Universe | L.Dre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_RVoLCx7MU&list=PLcZLVFyemx_bQ8pQ3VP2tdEXcXcEvy_Tg&index=1&pp=gAQBiAQB8AUB)) that is similar in sound and style to the one that I'd like to create for my coursework and analysed the drum and percussion parts. I identified a few percussive components such as soft and mellow elements like subtle hi-hats, gentle kicks, and snappy snares. I also examined that the rhythm track tends to be laid back, providing a relaxed and soothing vibe.

## Week 6: Bassline Basics
- Due to the lack of a physical bass instrument, using software presets is the preferred method.

- I found the chords for the Adventure Time theme song and used them to create a simple bassline.
