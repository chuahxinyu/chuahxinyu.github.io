Above are some data types that we'll be learning in COMP10001. Highlighted are what we've learnt from the lectures so far. Python offers many more built-in data types that can be explored [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).

### Discussion 1

D1. What is a "data type"? Can the data type of an object change?

{% pycode isRunnable=false %}

```python
Type your answer to D1 here...
```

{% /pycode %}

### Discussion 2

D2: As a class, ﬁll in the below table with the data types we have studied so far. What is the difference between the second and third type, both being numerical?
|Type|Example|What does it store?|What can we do with it (functions, operations...)?|How do we convert to it?|
|--|--|--|--|--|
||`"Hello"`||||
||`123`||||
||`3.1415`||||
||`True`||||

{% pycode %}

```
# print(type("Hello"))
# input("Please enter some input: ")
# len("Hello")
# print("Hello")
# print("Hello"[1:3]) # string slicing
# print("Hello"[4]) # string indexing
# print("HELLO".lower()) # .lower() method
# print("hello".upper()) # .upper() method

# print(type(123))
# print(1 + 1) #quickmaths
# print(1 // 2) # integer division rounds down

# print(type(3.1415))
# print(1 + 1.0) # int + float = float
# print(1 / 1) # int / int = float (division creates floats)

# print(type(True))
# print(bool("")) # empty string
# print(bool(" ")) # non-empty string
# print(bool())
```

{% /pycode %}

### Exercise 1

E1. Look at the following customer data form, and decide which data types (str, int, float, or bool) should be used to store each ﬁeld.

- Name:
- Customer ID:
- Address:
- Postcode:
- Do you own or rent?:
- Length of bench top:
- Width of bench top:
- Are you interested in further offers?:

### Exercise 2

E2. Evaluate the following

1. `str(3 + 4) + "cakes"`
2. `int(5/2)`
3. `float("357"+ "."+ "23")`
4. `bool("anything")`

## Arithmetic Operators

### Discussion 3

D3. What is an “operator”? Which operators have we
learned so far and what do they do?

### Discussion 4

D4. What is “operator overloading”? What is the difference between using + with numerical types and strings/sequences?

{% pycode %}

```
print(1 + 1) # int + int
print("1" + "1") # str + str
print("1" + 1) # str + int
```

{% /pycode %}

## Variables

### Discussion 5

D5. What is a “variable”? How do we use variables and why are they helpful?

### Exercise 3

E3. Evaluate the following given the assignments a = 1, b = 2, c = 2.0:

1. `a / a`
2. `b + b`
3. `b + c`
4. `a / b`
5. `a // b`
6. `a % b`
7. `a + b / c`
8. `(a + b) / c`

### Exercise 4

E4. What is the output of the following? Why?

1. `123 + 123`
2. `"123" + "123"`
3. `"123" + 123`
4. `3 * 4`
5. `"3" * 4`
6. `"3" * "4"`

## Extra Questions

### Extra Question 6

EQ6. How does the `input()` function work?

### Extra Question 7

EQ7. What is a literal?

### Extra Question 8

EQ8. Why does 0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1 equal 0.9999999999999999 and not 1.0?
{% pycode %}

```
# Discussion 8: Floating Point Error
print(1.2 - 1.0) # what do you expect the answer to be?
# print(((1.2 * 10) - (1.0 * 10)) / 10) # Solution 1: turn the floats to whole numbers
```

{% /pycode %}

## Problems

### Problem 1

{% pycode %}

```
"""
P1: Write a program which asks the user for their age and calculates the year in
which they were born. There will be two possibilities since you haven’t asked
for their birth date, so print both.
"""
```

{% /pycode %}

### Problem 2

{% pycode %}

```
"""
P2: Write a program which asks the user for two integers and multiplies them
together, printing the equation in the form 1 * 2 = 2 for the case of 1 and 2.
"""
```

{% /pycode %}

### Problem 3

{% pycode %}

```
"""
P3: Write a program which asks the user for a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and
prints the corresponding value in Celsius. The conversion formula is below:
    C = (F - 32) / 1.8
"""
```
